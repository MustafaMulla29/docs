## Overview

A `<battery />` is a power source that provides electrical energy through electrochemical reactions. Batteries are essential components that supply power to electronic circuits and devices. They have a positive and negative terminal and must be connected with correct polarity.

A battery element has two pins and is polarized, meaning it has a positive terminal (cathode) and a negative terminal (anode). The voltage and capacity of the battery determine how much power it can provide and for how long.

When specifying a battery, you'll need to provide the voltage rating and optionally the capacity. Common battery types include AA, AAA, 9V, coin cells, and lithium-ion batteries.

  )

  `}

## Pins

A battery has the following pins and aliases:

| Pin # | Aliases | Description |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| pin1 | pos, positive, cathode | The positive terminal that provides current |
| pin2 | neg, negative, anode | The negative terminal that completes the circuit |

:::warning
Batteries are polarized components! You must connect the positive and negative terminals correctly. Reversing polarity can damage your circuit or the battery itself.

## Specifications

Batteries can be configured with these key properties:

- **capacity** - The energy storage capacity specified in mAh or Ah e.g. `"2500mAh"`, `"1.2Ah"`

## Common Battery Types

Here are some common battery types and their typical specifications:

| Battery Type | Voltage | Typical Capacity | Chemistry |
| ------------ | ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| AA | 1.5V | 2000-3000mAh | Alkaline |
| AAA | 1.5V | 800-1200mAh | Alkaline |
| 9V | 9V | 400-600mAh | Alkaline |
| CR2032 | 3V | 200-250mAh | Lithium coin cell |
| 18650 | 3.7V | 2500-3500mAh | Lithium-ion |

## Schematic Orientation

Batteries can display their positive and negative terminals in different orientations. Use the `schOrientation` property to control the symbol orientation.

Valid orientation values are:

- `horizontal`
- `vertical`
- `pos_left`
- `pos_right`
- `pos_top`
- `pos_bottom`
- `neg_left`
- `neg_right`
- `neg_top`
- `neg_bottom`

```tsx
<battery
  name="BAT1"
  capacity="2500mAh"
  schOrientation="pos_left"
  schX={0}
  schY={0}
  connections={{ pos: "net.VCC", neg: "net.GND" }}
/>
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Power Supply

```tsx
<battery
  name="BAT1"
  capacity="2000mAh"
/>
```

### High Capacity Battery

```tsx
<battery
  name="BAT1"
  capacity="3000mAh"
/>
```

### Small Capacity Battery

```tsx
<battery
  name="BAT_RTC"
  capacity="220mAh"
/>
```

:::tip
When designing battery-powered circuits, consider adding battery monitoring circuitry to track voltage levels and prevent over-discharge, especially for rechargeable batteries.
